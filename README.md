## üéÆ **What is This?**

A revolutionary text-based monster-catching game that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create truly unique creatures. Every monster you encounter is generated from scratch with its own personality, backstory, abilities, and motivations. Chat with them, earn their trust, and watch them evolve based on your interactions.

**This isn't just a game‚Äîit's a demonstration of AI in interactive entertainment.**

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites (Install BEFORE running setup)

#### ‚úÖ **Required Software:**
1. **Python 3.8+** - [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Node.js 16+** - [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) 
   - ‚úÖ npm comes included with Node.js
3. **MySQL Server** - [Download MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** MySQL Workbench is just the GUI - you need the actual server
   - üí° During installation, remember your root password!
4. **Git** - [Download from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### üéØ **For CUDA Support (Recommended for AI features):**
5. **NVIDIA GPU Drivers** - [Download latest drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers/)
6. **CUDA Toolkit** - [Download CUDA 12.x](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
7. **Visual Studio Build Tools** - [Download Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
   - Install the "C++ build tools" workload

#### üîß **Hardware Requirements:**
- **NVIDIA GPU** with 8GB+ VRAM (for AI model acceleration)
- **32GB RAM** recommended (16GB minimum)
- **10GB+ free storage**

### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bloodtailor/LlmMonsterHunter.git
cd LlmMonsterHunter

# 2. Make sure MySQL Server is running
# Check in MySQL Workbench or run: sc query MySQL84

# 3. Verify Node.js and npm are working
node --version
npm --version

# 4. Run automated setup (handles Python dependencies, React setup, database config)
python setup_environment.py

# 5. Download an LLM model
# Create a 'models' folder and download a GGUF format model
# Recommended: Llama 2 7B Chat or Mistral 7B Instruct
# Example: llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf

# 6. Configure your environment
# Edit the .env file with your MySQL password and model path
# Example:
# DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
# LLM_MODEL_PATH=models/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf

# 7. Start the backend server
python backend/run.py

# 8. In a new terminal window, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

üéâ **The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`**

### What the Setup Script Does

The `setup_environment.py` script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Checks your system requirements
- ‚úÖ Creates a Python virtual environment in `backend/venv/`
- ‚úÖ Installs Python dependencies with CUDA support
- ‚úÖ Installs React frontend dependencies
- ‚úÖ Creates a `.env` configuration file
- ‚úÖ Sets up the models directory
- ‚úÖ Attempts to create the MySQL database

### Troubleshooting

#### **What are Node.js and npm?**
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside web browsers
- **npm:** Node Package Manager - comes with Node.js, manages JavaScript libraries
- **Why we need them:** React frontend is built with JavaScript and needs these tools
- **To verify:** Run `node --version` and `npm --version` in command prompt

#### **"Node.js & npm" check failed but Node.js detected:**
- This is usually a false positive - if Node.js version shows, you have npm
- Verify with: `npm --version`
- Continue with setup, it should work fine

#### **"MySQL Database" check failed:**
- Make sure MySQL **Server** is installed and running (not just Workbench)
- MySQL Workbench = GUI tool, MySQL Server = actual database
- Check if running: `sc query MySQL84` (Windows) or check MySQL Workbench
- The setup script will try to create the database for you
- If it fails, manually create: `CREATE DATABASE monster_hunter_game;`

#### **CUDA compilation takes forever:**
- This is normal! Can take 10-15 minutes
- The script tries multiple methods to get CUDA working
- If all else fails, it installs CPU-only version (slower but works)

#### **Running setup multiple times:**
- ‚úÖ **Safe to rerun!** Script checks what's already done and skips it
- Use this if you need to install prerequisites and run again
