## Session 5 Goals 🎯
**Priority:** Monster System Foundation - Create and display your first AI-generated monster!

**Clarification from Discussion:**
- No "player character" - the user IS the player
- No complex save/load system - just simple game state persistence
- Focus on monsters as the core game entities
- One continuous game session (resume where you left off)

**Files to create:**
- `backend/models/monster.py` (80 lines) - Core monster model with AI-generated fields
- `backend/routes/monster_routes.py` (70 lines) - Monster CRUD API endpoints  
- `backend/services/monster_service.py` (60 lines) - Monster business logic
- `frontend/src/components/game/MonsterCard.js` (80 lines) - Display monster with image/stats
- `frontend/src/hooks/useMonsters.js` (50 lines) - Monster state management

**What you'll be able to test:**
- Create your first monster with AI-generated name, description, abilities
- Save monster to MySQL database
- Display monster in React component with placeholder image
- Basic monster roster management
- Foundation for future LLM integration

**Documentation updates needed:**
- Remove complex save/load references from requirements.md, use_cases.md, gameplay_design.md
- Clarify game state persistence approach

## Session 6 Goals (Preview) 🔮
**Priority:** Game State Management and Home Base Monster Roster
- Simple game state persistence (current location, roster, inventory)
- Home base monster management UI
- Monster party selection system (choose 4 for dungeons)
- Basic inventory system
- Complete home base functionality

## Technical Foundation Achieved 🏗️

### Backend Architecture ✅
- Flask application factory pattern
- SQLAlchemy with MySQL integration
- Modular route and service organization
- Base model with common functionality
- Proper error handling and logging

### Frontend Architecture ✅
- React app with API connectivity
- Modular component organization
- Centralized API service layer
- Theme-based CSS architecture
- Developer tools and testing interface

### Full-Stack Integration ✅
- CORS properly configured
- API endpoints working
- Error handling across stack
- Development workflow established
- Both servers running smoothly

## Development Workflow 🔄

### Current Process:
1. **Backend first:** Create model, routes, service
2. **Test API:** Use `test_backend.py` or React developer tools
3. **Frontend second:** Create components and hooks
4. **Integration test:** Verify full-stack functionality
5. **Update log:** Document progress and next steps

### Quality Standards:
- Heavy commenting explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- One concept per file for easy understanding
- Modular, reusable components
- Consistent error handling
- Working code over perfect architecture

## Notes for Claude 📝
- User learns by building and testing working features immediately
- Focus on monsters as core game entities, not "player characters"
- Windows 11 environment with MySQL database
- Keep files under 200 lines for manageable development
- Prioritize working software over documentation perfection
- User wants to see AI-generated content working in Session 5!

## Current Status: Ready for Monster System! 🐉
Both servers running, full-stack communication working, ready to create the first real game entities.
