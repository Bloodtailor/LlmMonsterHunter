# Development Log

## Current Status
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] File tree template completed
- [x] Environment setup and requirements checking completed
- [x] Basic Flask app setup ✨ NEW
- [x] Database connection configuration ✨ NEW
- [x] SQLAlchemy base model created ✨ NEW
- [x] Application runner script created ✨ NEW
- [x] Backend testing script created ✨ NEW
- [ ] First API endpoint tested and working
- [ ] Database tables created
- [ ] React frontend basic setup

## Session 1 Completed Files ✨
**Priority:** Get basic Flask app running with database connection
**Files created:** 
- `backend/app.py` (73 lines) - Flask application factory with health/status endpoints
- `backend/config/database.py` (89 lines) - SQLAlchemy configuration and connection management
- `backend/models/base.py` (106 lines) - Base model class with common fields and methods
- `backend/run.py` (54 lines) - Application runner with startup info
- `test_backend.py` (200 lines) - Comprehensive API testing script

## How to Test Session 1 Work

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
```bash
# From project root directory
python backend/run.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Test Script (in new terminal)
```bash
# From project root directory  
python test_backend.py
```

### Expected Results:
- Flask server starts on localhost:5000
- Database connection is verified
- Two API endpoints working: /api/health and /api/game/status
- All 5 tests pass in test script

## What We Built

### Flask Application Factory Pattern
- `create_app()` function creates configured Flask instance
- Environment variables loaded from .env
- CORS enabled for React frontend
- Database URI built from env vars
- Modular blueprint registration

### Database Integration
- SQLAlchemy configured for MySQL
- Connection testing and error handling
- Base model with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
- Standard save/delete methods
- JSON serialization support

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with database status
- `GET /api/game/status` - Game information and feature flags

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test script covering:
  - Server connectivity
  - Database connection via API
  - CORS headers for frontend
  - Error handling (404s)
  - Response format validation

## Session 2 Goals
**Priority:** Create Player model and basic game API endpoints
**Files to focus on:** 
- `backend/models/player.py` - Player model with game state
- `backend/routes/game_routes.py` - Game state API endpoints  
- `backend/services/game_service.py` - Game business logic
- Update database to create Player table
- Test player creation and game state persistence

## Notes for Claude
- User wants to see working code and test it immediately
- Focus on one concept per file, heavily commented
- Windows 11 environment with NVIDIA GPU
- MySQL database already configured via setup system
- User learns by troubleshooting together as issues arise
- Keep building modular, organized codebase
