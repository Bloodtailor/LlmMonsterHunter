# Risk Analysis

**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Document Type:** Planning Phase Deliverable

## Risk Assessment Overview

This analysis identifies potential risks to the Monster Hunter Game project and outlines strategies for managing them. Each risk is evaluated based on probability and severity, with appropriate mitigation strategies defined.

## Identified Risks

### 1. Time Commitment & Burnout Risks

**Description:** You might underestimate how much time it takes, leading to frustration or burnout. Balancing the project with other responsibilities (work, studies, social life) can be challenging. Passion projects can become overwhelming if they start feeling like an obligation.

- **Probability:** High
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Accept

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Flexible scheduling with realistic time commitments
- Clear prioritization of competing obligations
- Regular breaks and assessment of enjoyment levels
- Permission to pause project when needed without guilt

### 2. Scope Creep Risks

**Description:** As you get more ideas, the project might expand beyond what you initially planned, making it harder to complete. Without clear goals or a structured plan, you might keep adding features without finishing core functionalities.

- **Probability:** High
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Avoidance

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Use the waterfall method to clearly define scope before beginning implementation
- Maintain a strict feature freeze during development phases
- Document enhancement ideas separately for future iterations
- Regular scope reviews against original requirements

### 3. Technical Challenges Risks

**Description:** You may encounter complex problems that require more knowledge than you currently have. Debugging and troubleshooting can be time-consuming and frustrating. Learning new technologies or frameworks might slow you down initially.

- **Probability:** High
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Accept

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Allocate dedicated time for learning and skill development
- Start with simplified implementations and iterate
- Leverage AI assistance and online resources for problem-solving
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable components

### 4. Motivation Risks

**Description:** The excitement of starting a new project can fade over time, making it harder to stay consistent. If progress is slow or you hit roadblocks, it can be discouraging.

- **Probability:** High
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Accept

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Focus on working software over documentation to maintain engagement
- Celebrate small wins and progress milestones
- Maintain project visibility and regular progress reviews
- Connect with the fun aspects of the project regularly

### 5. Financial Risks

**Description:** Some tools, software, or hardware might require purchases. If you're hosting a project online, there could be server or domain costs.

- **Probability:** Low
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Accept

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Prioritize free and open-source software solutions
- Use local deployment to avoid hosting costs
- Monitor resource usage and costs proactively
- Have contingency plans for unexpected expenses

### 6. Finishing & Next Steps Risks

**Description:** You might struggle to decide when the project is "done" or what to do with it afterward. If you planned for it to turn into something bigger (e.g., a business or portfolio piece), transitioning from a personal project to a public or commercial product can be difficult.

- **Probability:** High
- **Severity:** Low
- **Strategy:** Avoidance

**Mitigation Measures:**
- The end criteria is clearly stated in the System Request
- Project completion can be inferred from the System Proposal and System Design Documentation
- Define success metrics early and stick to them
- Plan post-project activities and next steps in advance

## Risk Summary

### Main Risks That Could Cause Project Failure

1. **Time Commitment & Burnout**
2. **Technical Challenges** 
3. **Motivation Loss**

### Risk Acceptance Rationale

Because the severity for failing the project is low, these risks are acceptable. The project is designed as a learning experience with flexible scope, making failure a valuable learning opportunity rather than a critical setback.

### Overall Risk Assessment

- **High Probability Risks:** Most identified risks have high probability due to the ambitious nature of the project and skill development requirements
- **Low Severity Impact:** All risks have low severity because this is a personal development project with flexible requirements
- **Risk Tolerance:** High - the learning value and low cost of failure make risks acceptable

## Contingency Planning

### If Technical Challenges Become Overwhelming
- Scale back to simplified MVP version
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Seek additional learning resources or mentorship

### If Motivation Declines
- Revisit original project goals and excitement factors
- Take planned breaks without project guilt
- Celebrate progress made to date
- Consider pivoting to more motivating aspects

### If Time Becomes Unavailable
- Put project on planned hiatus with proper documentation
- Maintain project organization for future restart
- Consider reducing scope to fit available time

## Risk Monitoring

### Regular Assessment Points
- Monthly motivation and progress reviews
- Quarterly scope and timeline assessments
- Ongoing technical challenge evaluation

### Success Indicators
- Consistent progress toward milestones
- Maintained enthusiasm for the project
- Successful resolution of technical challenges
- Staying within defined scope boundaries
