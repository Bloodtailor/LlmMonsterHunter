# Feasibility Analysis

**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Document Type:** Planning Phase Deliverable

## Personal Goals and Motivation

This project is to have a bunch of fun applying my skills and get practical use on the things I have learned in school and to develop soft skills in creativity, time management, organization as well as hard skills in coding, programming, and AI. This is something that I am very passionate about and enjoy thinking about and doing and I am excited to do.

## Skill Feasibility

### Current Skills

- Education on systems development from the classes that I have taken in ISDS
- Experience working with AI through my hobbies
- Created chatbot api using excel VBA that allowed me to have role play conversations
- Created a personal finance project that uses AI to automatically categorize transactions
- Experience using HTML and CSS to create a working website on my local computer
- Experience working with APIs and local servers

### Work in Progress Skills

- No experience working in Python or any of the python libraries
- Never used JavaScript or React
- Never taken on a personal project this large before
- No experience incorporating coding logic with LLMs in this way
- Never deployed any of the databases that I've created
- Struggling with time management and self motivation recently

The skills that I do not have mentioned above are all things that I would love to learn and get better at. Learning these skills are a large part of the project's appeal for me.

## Time Feasibility

### Current Time Allocation

- Finishing school
- Looking for a job
- Looking for housing
- Planning trip to japan
- Learning spanish
- Learning Japanese

All together I am very busy and do not have time to work on this project. Realistically, I could only work a couple hours a week once I've finished all of my other obligations. However, there is no need to finish this project by a specific date, I can stop and start whenever I like. I worry however, that if I keep starting and stopping, I will lose motivation to finish the project. For this reason, I would like to finish the project in a reasonable time frame (i.e. 3-6 months).

## Resource Feasibility

All software is free and my computer has enough RAM and a strong enough GPU to run the AI models at reasonable speed.

### Hardware Requirements Met
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM)
- 64GB RAM
- Intel i7 processor

### Software Requirements
All planned software is free/open-source:
- Python and associated libraries
- MySQL database
- React development tools
- Local LLM models (no API costs)

If any hardware or software needs to be purchased, it will be documented here.

## Scope Feasibility

This project is a solo effort. If I need help with this project, I can reach out to my professors for help with project management help and database design help. For the LLM side, I may not be able to find any help. For the coding side, I can have AI help me. If the current scope is too big, I can scale it back to only be LLM generated monster cards for pre-existing stats and abilities.

### Support Resources Available
- **Project Management:** CSUF professors for SDLC methodology guidance
- **Database Design:** Academic resources and professor consultation
- **Programming:** AI-assisted development tools
- **LLM Integration:** Self-directed learning and experimentation

### Scope Flexibility
The project scope can be adjusted based on progress and learning curve:
- **Full Vision:** Complete monster generation, evolution, and battle systems
- **Reduced Scope:** Basic monster cards with simplified gameplay
- **Minimum Viable:** Text-based game with basic LLM integration

## Enjoyment and Practicality

This project is very fun for me and I'm excited to see what comes of it. I believe I will enjoy playing the final project and will be creating updates for it for years to come. I think it will be a fun thing to add to my resume and will be a good talking point that will allow me to show off some of my skills and a bit of my character. Pushing myself hard to an exciting goal is reason enough for me. I think I will learn a lot from putting everything I've learned up until now together into one place.

### Long-term Benefits
- **Portfolio Enhancement:** Demonstrable full-stack project with AI integration
- **Skill Development:** Practical application of academic knowledge
- **Personal Satisfaction:** Creative outlet combining multiple interests
- **Career Advancement:** Showcase of self-directed learning and project management

## Summary

While there are a lot of skills that I do not have and many risks to the project, failure is low stakes and success has high returns. This project is something that I will enjoy and will provide me with experience using many skills that will be applicable in my career.

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Technical Feasibility:** ✅ High (hardware capable, software available)
- **Time Feasibility:** ⚠️ Moderate (competing priorities, flexible timeline)
- **Skill Feasibility:** ✅ High (strong foundation, willing to learn)
- **Resource Feasibility:** ✅ High (minimal cost, existing hardware adequate)
- **Scope Feasibility:** ✅ High (flexible scope, scalable approach)

### Recommendation
**Proceed with project implementation** - The feasibility analysis indicates strong potential for success with appropriate scope management and realistic timeline expectations.
