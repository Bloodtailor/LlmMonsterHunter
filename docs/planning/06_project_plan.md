# Project Plan

**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Document Type:** Planning Phase Deliverable

## Executive Summary

This project plan outlines the development of a text-based monster-catching game that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic content generation. The game will allow players to capture, raise, evolve, and battle monsters in procedurally generated dungeons.

## Project Purpose

**Primary:** Apply educational knowledge from CSUF Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Data Science  
**Secondary:** Acquire new career-relevant skills in Python and React  
**Tertiary:** Demonstrate practical application of LLM technology in gaming

*Reference: System Request*

## Key Objectives

- Create a fully functional text-based game with AI-generated content
- Implement a strategic turn-based battle system
- Develop dynamic monster generation and evolution systems
- Create an intuitive user interface using React
- Document the entire development process using SDLC methodology

## Scope

### In Scope
- Text-based gameplay with visual UI elements
- Turn-based battle system
- Monster generation using LLMs
- Monster evolution system
- Dungeon exploration mechanics
- Local deployment for personal use
- Complete system documentation
- Development of all SDLC deliverables

*Reference: System Proposal (Work in Progress)*

### Out of Scope
- Animations and complex graphics
- Multiplayer functionality
- Online deployment
- Monetization features
- Sound effects and music
- Mobile platform support
