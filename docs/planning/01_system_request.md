# System Request

**Project Sponsor:** Aaron Orelup  
**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Document Type:** Planning Phase Deliverable

## Introduction

**Goal:** Apply career relevant skills learned at college/home and learn python and AI inferencing skills through programming an LLM based game.

**Type:** Monster catcher game.

**Gameplay:** Capture, raise, and battle monsters in dungeons.

**Development Timeframe:** One year.

**Work Schedule:** 8 hours per week, once a week.

**Design:** Text-based with a visually appealing UI, no animations.

## Overview

This request is for a unique fantasy-themed monster-catching game that leverages LLMs to dynamically generate game content. The game aims to provide players with a rich, strategic experience where they can capture, raise, evolve, and battle diverse monsters.

## Purpose

### Primary Objective
The primary objective of this project is to give me a chance to apply the education I have received at CSUF by obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Data Science, the practical knowledge I have gained working in excel at AERI as a data analyst, and the LLM skills I have gained through my various hobbies.

### Secondary Objective
To acquire new skills that may be helpful for my career such as Python and React.

## Scope

The game will feature a text-based, turn-based battle system where players control multiple monsters to engage in strategic battles against AI-generated opponents. Key elements include dynamic monster designs, evolving abilities, procedural dungeon generation, and AI-driven visual content.

## Need

The purpose of this project is to apply my education, work experience, and skills in AI on a project that inspires and motivates me for the following reasons:

- To act as capstone, applying my multifaceted knowledge cohesively on a real project
- To build self-esteem by having tangible outcomes to my skills
- To add to my resume a self motivated project that demonstrates work skills
- To fill in gaps in my knowledge
- To learn new skills that were not offered at my college but are necessary to my work
- To act as a relaxing, productive hobby

## Requirements

- Must showcase the capabilities of LLMs
- Majority of time spent on the project must be beneficial to me
- Must use the SDLC methodology I learned in my ISDS class
- Must be programmed in python
- Must involve a database

## Value

- Experience creating all ISDS deliverables for a single project
- Experience using servers (for LLMs, Image Generation, and Web Hosting)
- Experience handling a project from start to finish
- Experience working with AI on an original project
- Experience with coding web pages
- Demonstration of organization and time management skills
- An item to proudly display on the resume

## Success Criteria

The project's success will be measured by the following criteria:

- Amount of fun I was working on it
- Amount of skills I was able to apply on it
- Amount of the project work plan that was completed
- Amount of new skills I learning in the process
- Project is something I am proud of
- Amount of experience I gained in AI
- Project showcases this avenue of involving AI in video games
