## 🎯 Project Vision

### Core Concept
A text-based monster-catching game that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic content generation, creating unique monsters with personalities, abilities, and backstories that evolve through player interaction.

### Key Innovation
**AI-Driven Gameplay:** Every monster is generated from scratch by an LLM, complete with personality, backstory, abilities, and visual representation. Player conversations and battle experiences directly influence monster development and evolution.

### Technical Goals
- Apply CSUF Information Systems and Data Science education
- Learn Python, React, and full-stack development
- Master LLM integration in real-world applications
- Create portfolio-worthy demonstration of AI in gaming

## 🔄 Development Methodology Evolution

### Original Approach (February 2025)
- **Waterfall SDLC** with comprehensive upfront documentation
- Risk of losing motivation due to documentation overhead

### Revised Approach (June 2025)
- **Rapid Prototyping / MVP-First Development**
- Build working software quickly to validate concepts
- Learn by doing, iterate based on experience

### Catalyst for Change
Three-month Android app development project provided practical experience with:
- Python model loading and inference
- Local server setup and API design
- Prompt engineering and model testing

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** with Flask framework
- **MySQL** database for persistent storage
- **Llama-cpp-python** for local LLM inference
- **ComfyUI** for AI image generation

### Frontend
- **React 18+** with modern JavaScript
- **HTML5/CSS3** for semantic, responsive design
- **RESTful API** communication with backend

### AI Integration
- **Local LLM Models** for privacy and control
- **Custom prompt engineering** for game-specific content
- **Image generation workflows** for monster artwork

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] Functional game with complete core loop
- [ ] Stable AI integration and content generation
- [ ] Complete SDLC documentation
- [ ] Local deployment working smoothly

### Learning Success
- [ ] Practical full-stack development experience
- [ ] LLM integration in real application context
- [ ] Database design and management skills
- [ ] Project completion satisfaction

### Gameplay Success
- [ ] Engaging core gameplay loop (30+ minutes)
- [ ] Interesting variety in generated monsters
- [ ] Strategic depth despite simplified mechanics
- [ ] Emotional connection through monster chat system

## 🚀 MVP Scope

### Core Features (Simplified Implementation)
- **Home Base System:** Monster roster and inventory management
- **Dungeon Exploration:** Three-door choice system with encounters
- **Battle System:** Turn-based combat with basic actions
- **Monster Chat:** Conversational interface with captured monsters
- **Monster Generation:** AI-created monsters with basic stats and abilities

### Deliberately Simplified for MVP
- **Monster Abilities:** 1-2 basic abilities instead of complex trees
- **Battle Processing:** Basic math-driven combat with LLM narrative
- **Evolution System:** Title changes only (e.g., "Rokk" → "Rokk the Brave")
- **Story Elements:** Basic personalities and motivations
