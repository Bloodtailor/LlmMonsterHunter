# Story Design

**Date:** February 28, 2025  
**Document Type:** Design Phase Deliverable

## Purpose and Requirements of the Story

The story in this game serves as a foundational tool to enhance the creativity and depth of the AI-generated monsters. While the player will not directly experience the written story, it will guide the language model (LLM) to generate richer and more compelling interactions through the monsters' motivations and behaviors. 

To achieve this, the story must meet the following requirements:

### Design Requirements

**Simplicity and Clarity:** The story must be straightforward and self-explanatory to enable the LLM to use it effectively as a creative base.

**Adaptability:** The story must be flexible enough to allow iterative adjustments, ensuring that it optimally influences the LLM to produce desired outputs.

**Support for Creativity:** The story should act as a prompt to inspire the LLM to develop diverse and interesting backstories, motivations, and actions for the monsters.

### Narrative Function

In summary, the story is not a narrative for the player but a framework that empowers the AI to generate engaging and meaningful monster interactions.

## The Story Concept

In this world, there exists a mysterious and unparalleled power capable of granting any wish. This power is sought after by all monsters, each driven by their unique desires and dreams. Every monster the player encounters has its own wish it yearns to fulfill and a personal reason for seeking the power.

This premise is intentionally broad and open-ended, providing endless room for the LLM to create intricate and varied motivations for the monsters. For example, one monster may wish to revive a loved one, while another seeks ultimate power or eternal peace. The diversity of these wishes will add depth to the gameplay, making every encounter feel personal and meaningful.
