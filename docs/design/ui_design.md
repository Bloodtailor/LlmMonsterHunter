# User Interface Design

**Date:** February 28, 2025  
**Document Type:** Design Phase Deliverable

## Design Philosophy

The user interface (UI) of the game is designed to be as minimal and text-based as possible while providing continuity and structure to the gameplay and to focus on allowing the user to use their own imagination to create visualizations. The UI visuals are meant to be a catalyst to spark more creativity in the user to make their own visualizations. The UI elements will focus on enhancing gameplay visibility and facilitating strategic decision-making within the game.

### Core Design Principles

#### Minimalism and Imagination
- **Text-First Approach:** Prioritize descriptive text over complex graphics
- **Visual Catalysts:** Use simple visuals to inspire player imagination rather than define everything explicitly
- **Cognitive Space:** Leave room for players to mentally visualize and personalize their experience
- **Focus on Function:** Every UI element serves a clear gameplay purpose

#### Clarity and Accessibility
- **Information Hierarchy:** Clear visual organization of important vs. secondary information
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Logical flow between game screens and functions
- **Readable Typography:** Clear, legible text that doesn't strain the eyes during extended play
- **Consistent Interactions:** Similar actions work the same way across different screens

## Visual Representation

### Monster Visuals
Each monster will be visually represented through dynamic images generated by ComfyUI, reflecting AI-generated designs and evolutions. These visuals will accompany textual descriptions and symbols that denote monster traits and abilities.

**Implementation:**
- **AI-Generated Artwork:** Each monster receives a unique image created by ComfyUI
- **Trait Symbols:** Simple icons represent abilities like flight, elemental affinity, or special skills
- **Evolution Visualization:** Visual updates when monsters evolve or gain titles
- **Card-Based Display:** Monster information presented in card format for easy scanning

### Battle Interface

During battles, the UI will display:

**Monster Symbols:** Icons or symbols representing traits such as flight, elemental affinity, or special abilities, aiding players in strategic decision-making.

**Action Menus:** Intuitive menus for selecting monster actions, such as attacks, defensive maneuvers, or special skills, enhancing player control and tactical planning.

**Battle Information:** Clear display of health, energy, status effects, and turn order

### Text-Based Gameplay

#### Immersive Descriptions
Gameplay interactions will be primarily text-based, encouraging players to visualize the action through vivid descriptions of monster encounters, battle sequences, and dungeon exploration.

**Implementation:**
- **Rich Descriptive Text:** Detailed narration of actions and events
- **Atmospheric Writing:** Text that establishes mood and setting
- **Dynamic Content:** LLM-generated descriptions that vary based on context
- **Player Imagination:** Text designed to spark mental imagery rather than constrain it

#### Information Clarity
Clear and concise textual displays will provide essential information, including monster stats, health points, and status effects, ensuring players make informed decisions during gameplay.

**Design Standards:**
- **Consistent Formatting:** Standardized presentation of numerical data
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information emphasized through size and positioning
- **Scannable Layout:** Easy to quickly find relevant information
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Detailed information available on demand without cluttering main view
