# User Interface Design

**Date:** February 28, 2025  
**Document Type:** Design Phase Deliverable

## Design Philosophy

The user interface (UI) of the game is designed to be as minimal and text-based as possible while providing continuity and structure to the gameplay and to focus on allowing the user to use their own imagination to create visualizations. The UI visuals are meant to be a catalyst to spark more creativity in the user to make their own visualizations. The UI elements will focus on enhancing gameplay visibility and facilitating strategic decision-making within the game.

### Core Design Principles

#### Minimalism and Imagination
- **Text-First Approach:** Prioritize descriptive text over complex graphics
- **Visual Catalysts:** Use simple visuals to inspire player imagination rather than define everything explicitly
- **Cognitive Space:** Leave room for players to mentally visualize and personalize their experience
- **Focus on Function:** Every UI element serves a clear gameplay purpose

#### Clarity and Accessibility
- **Information Hierarchy:** Clear visual organization of important vs. secondary information
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Logical flow between game screens and functions
- **Readable Typography:** Clear, legible text that doesn't strain the eyes during extended play
- **Consistent Interactions:** Similar actions work the same way across different screens
