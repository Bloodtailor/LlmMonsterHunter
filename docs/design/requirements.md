## MVP Considerations

Based on the [MVP Development Strategy](../strategy/mvp_development_strategy.md), the following requirements are **simplified for initial implementation**:

### Simplified Monster Abilities
- **Original Requirement:** Complex ability trees and dynamic ability acquisition
- **MVP Implementation:** 1-2 basic abilities per monster with predefined effects

### Simplified Battle Processing
- **Original Requirement:** Full LLM-processed battle outcomes
- **MVP Implementation:** Basic math-driven combat with simple LLM narrative enhancement

### Simplified Evolution System
- **Original Requirement:** Complete stat/ability regeneration with new artwork
- **MVP Implementation:** Title changes only (e.g., "Rokk" â†’ "Rokk the Brave")

### Simplified AI Integration
- **Original Requirement:** Complex emergent storytelling
- **MVP Implementation:** Basic personality responses and encounter descriptions

## Future Enhancement Requirements

The following requirements are **preserved for post-MVP iterations**:

- Advanced monster ability system with complex interactions
- Deep LLM integration for battle processing and narrative generation
- Complete evolution system with stat regeneration and new artwork
- Advanced inventory management with complex item effects
- Sophisticated AI-driven story generation
- Complex dungeon generation with varied encounter types
