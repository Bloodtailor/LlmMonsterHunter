# Game Loop v1 — Plan

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (July 2026).
**Branch:** `feature/game-loop-v1` — one milestone commit per milestone, prefix `Loop-M#`.

The July 2026 architecture review put it plainly: every verb exists —
explore, battle, talk, recruit, camp, chat, evolve — but there is no game
shell around them. Game Loop v1 is the smallest set of additions that
makes a complete, replayable arc: **title screen → guided first run →
runs with goals and stakes → a home base worth returning to.**

## Locked decisions (design review, July 2026)

1. **Single-world model** — no save profiles. New Game starts the guided
   opening against the existing database; Continue goes to home base.
2. **One goal per run** — no side-goals in v1.
3. **Affinity ladder** `wary → familiar → trusting → devoted`, stored on
   the monster. **Wary monsters act on their own in battle**: their turn
   auto-resolves like an enemy turn (LLM picks attack/ability/defend,
   personality-true) and the player watches. Devoted monsters get a
   friendlier referee note; affinity also rides chat and evolution
   context. This answers the design doc's disobedience question: yes —
   but as autonomy with personality, not command-refusal frustration.
4. **Recruits start at `wary`** — trust is earned through camps, heals,
   reunions, chats, and surviving runs together. Existing followers
   backfill to `trusting` so no current companion turns disobedient.
5. **Location descriptions describe the location itself** — structures,
   light, sound, history — never the party arriving. (Arrival narration
   is `look_around`'s job.) **Battle turn vanity is ONE sentence**: what
   the monster is thinking at this exact moment.
6. **Run modifiers live in one place:** a `run_context` dict (theme,
   danger, goal, first_run) inside the existing `dungeon_state` global
   variable, with a single `expedition_brief()` context block that every
   dungeon prompt receives. No scattered per-feature globals.
7. **Schema:** one nullable column (`monsters.affinity`) added by an
   idempotent dev script — no DB wipe (sanctuary monsters carry memories
   and evolutions now). `reset_db.py` remains for full resets.
8. **Out of scope:** sound/music, new animations, save profiles,
   shops/economy, multi-dungeon world map, trap events.

## Milestones

### M1 — Prompt fixes — IMPLEMENTED
`random_location` + `arrival_location` prompts and the generator
fallbacks describe the location itself (no party, no arrival);
`turn_vanity` becomes one present-moment sentence (`max_tokens` 300→100).

### M2 — Expedition notices: themes + danger — IMPLEMENTED
New `game/dungeon/run_context.py`: run_context read/write helpers,
`expedition_brief()`, and `DANGER_PROFILES` (`calm/risky/perilous` →
enemy count range, battle event weight, explore-monster chance,
returning weight, referee hint line). `generate_expedition_notices`
workflow (LLM writes 2-3 themed notices; **Python rolls each notice's
danger word**); `enter_dungeon` accepts a validated `notice_id`; theme
threads into entry/location/path/encounter prompts via
`{expedition_brief}`. Entrance screen gets the notice picker. Danger
table added to `docs/tuning.md`.

### M3 — Run goals — IMPLEMENTED
One themed goal generated at entry, riding in `expedition_brief()`.
After each resolved path event and each in-dungeon battle victory, a
`goal_check` referee call answers `no / progress / complete`; Python
ignores `complete` before `GOAL_MIN_EVENTS` (default 3). Completing the
goal earns an exit ceremony: one rare themed item + a `notable` growth
tier for the party. Defeat forfeits the reward.

### M4 — Stakes: provisional spoils — IMPLEMENTED
Dungeon state tracks `run_recruits`, run items, and run CoCaToks at
their sources (battle joins, dialogue joins, reunion joins, treasure,
rewards, victory keepsakes). Defeat and abandonment release the
provisional recruits (each gets a parting memory — the memories REMAIN)
and delete the run's items. Victory exit keeps everything.

### M5 — Affinity v1 — PLANNED
`Monster.affinity` column + `backend/tests/add_affinity_column.py`
(idempotent ALTER; backfills followers to `trusting`). New
`game/monster/affinity.py`: ladder, `step_affinity` (+1, capped, writes
a memory, emits `monster.affinity_changed`), `is_autonomous`, context
line, step-event knobs (first ally heal per run, camp rest, reunion,
run exit together, memory-extracting chat, evolution — capped by
`MAX_AFFINITY_STEPS_PER_RUN`). New `game/battle/turn/autonomy.py`: wary
allies auto-resolve via a new `ally_autonomous_turn` prompt; turn
payloads gain `autonomous: true`. Devoted/wary lines enter ally battle
blocks and the referee prompts; affinity rides chat + evolution context.
Affinity badge in the frontend; tuning table; `test_affinity.py`.

### M6 — Title screen + guided first run — PLANNED
`first_run_complete` global; TitleScreen (New Game / Continue) as the
app's opening screen. New Game → `begin_first_run` workflow streams the
wish-granting-power opening scene, then enters a `calm` fixed-theme
dungeon with a scripted event sequence: a winnable `monster_dialogue`
(the first monster is RECRUITED, not generated), one `monster_battle`
with the new companion (wary → it fights on its own terms), then a
forced exit path. Empty-party entry is allowed only for the first run;
the recruit auto-joins the active party; the fixed goal ("leave with a
new companion") completes on recruitment.

### M7 — Post-run chronicle — PLANNED
After every run end (victory or defeat): a streamed chronicle scene —
the run's log condensed into a story beat with the goal outcome, growth,
monsters met/recruited/lost, and the run number. Inputs are captured
before the state wipes; the final text persists to `DungeonRun.summary`.

## Verification

Offline suites (LLM stubbed, test DB): affinity ladder math + autonomy,
goal bookkeeping + valve, defeat-path spoils enforcement, first-run flag
flow + scripted sequence, notice validation + danger profiles. Static:
ruff, file-size ceiling, prettier, jest. Live soak after merge: full
first run start to finish; a themed run with a goal completed and one
failed; a defeat losing a provisional recruit and treasure; a wary
recruit acting on its own, then earning `familiar` and taking commands.

## Deviations

- **M2:** `run_context` lives in its own GlobalVariable key rather than
  inside `dungeon_state` — the theme must exist before the dungeon state
  row is created (the starting location is themed), and `start_dungeon`
  wholly replaces the state dict. Lifecycle stays single-pointed:
  `begin_run_context()` in enter, `clear_run_context()` inside
  `manager.exit_dungeon()`.
- **M2 (file-size ceiling):** threading the brief pushed two files over
  their limits, so two concepts moved out: dungeon fallbacks →
  `game/dungeon/fallbacks.py`, and the developer X-ray →
  `services/dungeon_debug_service.py`. The entrance auto-enter effect
  (replaced by the notice board) was deleted.
- **M4:** CoCaToks were documented as "permanent — deliberately no delete
  path" (models/cocatok.py). Stakes overrules that for keepsakes minted
  MID-RUN: they are provisional spoils like everything else the run
  gathered and are taken back on defeat/abandonment (new
  `inventory.cocatok_removed` event). Keepsakes carried out alive remain
  permanent; the model comment was updated in the same commit.
